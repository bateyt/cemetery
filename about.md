Hi, there. I'm a stay-at-home dad and biological anthropologist living in southern Oregon. When not taking care of my daughter, I'm an adjunct anthropology instructor and serve on the Oregon Commission on Historic Cemeteries. I created this website to share thoughts on some of my cemetery-related projects.
